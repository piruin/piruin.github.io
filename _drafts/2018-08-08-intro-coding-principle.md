# Coding Principle

While reading Ray Dalio's [Principles : Work and Life](https://www.principles.com/), I started to think that I would create 
my own coding's principles too. I hope it would to help me make decision easier and more consistant when handle same old problem
on my work. This may not the perfect principle and may evole by time.

## Saving power for making decision

In our career we usually face old problem in new form such as "How should I package my sourcecode on this new Project? 
by Structure? by Component?", "Which model whould be best MVC MVP or Otherelse", "What a style of method and variable 
name on project"

I wish this principles would help us make decision without stress and fear to be wrong or non-sense for ourself in future

## Increase Productivity


## It not perfect

Time by time, as I grown up my knowledge and skill. Some principle should be change. If not, 
That would be mean bad thing for me "The Deadend".
